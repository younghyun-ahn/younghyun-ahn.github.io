title: "Protocol Buffers 3"

Need to think about data model and efficiency of the API. 

* JSON / XML / Something Binary
* How much data do I get out of one call? 
* Too much data
* Too little data -> many API calls?
* Latency
* Scalability to 1000s of clients
* Load balancing
* Inter operability with many languages
* Authenticatin, Monitoring, Logging

## An Evolution of data type

### CSV (Comma Separated Values)

__Advantegs__:
* Easy to parse
* Easy to read
* Easy to make sense of

__Disadvantages:__ 
* The data types of elements has to be inferred and is not a guarantee
* Parsing becomes tricky when data contains commas
* Column names may or may not be there

### Relational tables definitions

__Advantages:__
* Data is fully typed
* Data fits in a table

__Disadvantages:__
* Data has to be flat
* Data is stored in a database, and data definition will be different for each database

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

__Advantages:__
* Data can take any form (arrays, nested elements)
* JSON is a widely accepted format on the web
* JSON can be read by pretty much any language
* JSON can be easily shared over a network

__Disadvantages:__
* Data has no schema enforcing
* JSON Objects can be quite big in size because of repeated keys
* No comments, metadata, documentation

### Protocol Buffers

Protocol Buffers is defined by a .proto text file. You can easily read it and understand it as a human.

__Advantages:__
* Data is fully typed
* Data is compressed automatically (less CPU usage)
* Schema (defined using .proto file) is needed to generate code and read the data
* Documentation can be embedded in the schema
* Data can be read across any language (C#, Java, Go, Python, Javascript, etc...)
* Schema can evolve over time, in a safe manager (schema evolution)
* `3-10x` smaller, `20-100x` faster than XML
* Code is generated for you automatically!

__Disadvantages:__
* Protobuf support for some languages might be lacking (but the amin ones is fine)
* Can't "open" the serialized data with a text editor (because it's compressed and serialised)

#### To share data accross languages!

![screenshot](../../../assets/images/protocol_buffers_accross_language.png)

#### Message structure

```go
// We are using proto3
syntax = "proto3"; 

// In Protocol Buffers we define message
message MyMessage {
	// Field Ttype, Field Name, Field Tag (e.g. Number)
	int32 id = 1;
	string first_name = 2;
	bool is_validated = 3;
}
```

#### Default Vlaues for fields

All fields, if not specified or unknown, will take a default value

* bool: false
* number (int32, etc...): 0
* string: empty string
* bytes: empty bytes
* enum: first value
* repeated: empty list

#### Enums

* If you know all the values a field can take in advance, you can leverage th Enum type
* `The first value of an Enum is the default value`
* Enum must start by the tag 0 (which is the default value)

#### Example

```go
// simple.proto

syntax = "proto3";

package simple;
option go_package="simple/simplepb";

message SimpleMessage {
  int32 id = 1;
  bool is_simple = 2;
  string name = 3;
  repeated int32 simple_list = 4;
}
```

```console
> protoc -I . --go_out=. simple/simplepb/simple.proto
```

```go
// main.go
func main() {
	sp := doSimple()
}

func doSimple() *simplepb.SimpleMessage {
	sp := simplepb.SimpleMessage{
		Id: 12345,
		IsSimple: true,
		Name: "My Simple Message",
		SimpleList: []int32{1, 2, 3, 4},
	}

	fmt.Println(sp)

	sp.Name = "I renamed you"
	fmt.Println(sp)

	fmt.Println("The ID is: ", sp.GetId())

	return &sp
}
```

```bash
‚ùØ go run main.go
0 [] 12345 true My Simple Message [1 2 3 4]
0 [] 12345 true I renamed you [1 2 3 4]
The ID is:  12345
```
